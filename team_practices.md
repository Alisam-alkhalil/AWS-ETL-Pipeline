Tentative answers as we don't have the time to discuss in detail at the moment.

- How are you going to operate efficiently as a team?
  - We will follow agile practices where possible,
  - Maintain good punctuality for meetings.
- Will you have a daily standup?
  - Yes, around 10-20 minute meetings at the beginning of each day.
- Will you have retrospectives?
  - Yes, for each sprint (at the end of each week).
- How will you structure your retro?
  - Similar structure to how we do repos for the generation course in general.
    - e.g. "what went well, didn't go well, could be improved" etc.
    - Also mentioning any blockers.
- How will you decide to split the workload?
  - We will use GitHub Projects to manage the workload assignment, task tracking, etc. (Kanban stuff).
  - Tentatively, we will start by each listing tasks we are happy to do, then the scrum leader will use this
    information to decide formally.
  - The size of tasks should be factored into these decisions.
  - These aspects are not final until we have a better idea of the workload.
- What methods of communication will you use?
  - We are planning to stay in calls on Teams most of the time.
    - Breakout rooms or private calls if 1:1 calls are needed (without distraction).
  - We can message in our team channel during breaks and lunch if there are any important updates for the group.
  - We can also communicate any story-specific information via the comments on github issues // on the github project.
- Will you use different git branches to create and test features in?
  - Yes, we will use branches to develop and test features individually before merging with the main branch.
- Will use make use of GitHub's Pull Request feature so that other members can review your code?
  - Yes, we intend to use pull requests for code reviews before merging to our main branch.
  - We want to have a minimum of two people review any feature pull requests before merging.
    - Each person making a pull request should designate two people, ideally those who have done the fewest
        PRs for them.
  - Mentioning any incoming changes / PRs in daily standups
    - Reminds or informs assigned code reviewers.
    - Ensures everyone on the project is aware of each feature coming into the main branch.
    - Any pending issues could be flagged here as well.

Extras:
- We may test Test Driven Design practices over a sprint.
  - This is TBD, during our sprint meetings.
  - Could be something to try over sprint 2 or 3?
